## About
- `Idlesys` is a project to create a significant leap forward in extensibility, interactibility, and knowledge distillation from personal journal digital information. It attempts to do this in its first form by creating an LSP which will serve to analyze entities, relations, identifiable subjects (dates, times, etc.) and attempt to build a locally stored knowledge multi-level graph. The knowledge graph that will be constructed from passing through one's natural language markdown data will (first of all, be much more complex, multilayered, and dimensional than many other iterations) and will be consulted by the server to provide useful completions, inlay hints, and other LSP general pleasantries which go beyond the syntactical and into the semantic. `05/29/22 10:54` 

### The Graph

## The Languages
- `imark` is designed first and foremost to be compatible with the digital file formats which users create while journalling or otherwise producing unstructured data -- thus, we are primarily focused on parsing `markdown` files at the moment, with a proper extension for those who wish it in the works (not just minimal additions -- intended to enable a whole new level of note-keeping, communication, etc.)
- Not opposed to branch out and begin looking at other possible sources of unstructured data. I.e. vimwiki data for Vimwiki users, Zim .txt data, .rst data, .asciidoc data, TODO.txt data, data from jrnl or kb, etc. These are long term goals. `05/29/22 10:58` 

### imark
- `imark` is the markdown language intended as a superset of markdown, enabling many powerful new features which may be used as the user wishes. `05/29/22 10:59` 

### imark-lsp
- `imark-lsp` is the language server protocol, capable of continual use not just with `imark` files (`.mdi`, `.im`) but also (and actually certainly intended more for) `markdown` to extract information about entities, relations, etc.



### idla
- `idla` is the high-and-low-level language intended to not just store data, but be an approachable DSL to help analyze, parse, extract, and relate information for the larger project purpose through advanced means and optimizations in its construction. `05/29/22 11:00`
